              <h5 class="card-title">BEKAL FORT</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Around 16 km to the south of northernmost district in Kerala, Kasaragod, lies the massive Bekal Fort. It is among the biggest forts in Kerala and has been impeccably maintained throughout the years. It rises to 130 feet above sea level and is situated on a headland spanning 35km. Much effort has been put to develop a beautiful beach here called the Bekal Fort Beach. People flock to these spots in great numbers. Situated comfortably on steep hills by the sea, the fort provides for an imposing view from the beach. Built using laterite slabs and with a polygonal shape, it is amongst the most visited sites in Kerala.

                There are many factors that have added to the popularity of the site. An observation tower fitted with beautiful peepholes, the Anjaneya Temple with its famous masonry and two Theyyam sculptures built from laterite are among the primary attractions. An ancient mosque built by Tipu Sultan and various underground passageways are also important places in the area. A rock garden was built using laterite in the parking area and is an architectural marvel in itself.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">RANIPURAM</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Ranipuram is a renowned tourist destination in the northern tip of Kerala. Located in Kasaragod, it is situated 750 m above sea level. It makes for a perfect picnic spot where one can even come across the occasional herd of elephants. Once known as Madathumala, it borders Karnataka and boasts of some of the best trekking trails in the area. Regular buses are available on this route and jeep rides are another favourite among all our visitors. The versatile vegetation that includes evergreen shola woods, monsoon forests and grasslands make it a good place to relax and take some time off from the rigors of daily life. Ranipuram, about 85 kms from Kasaragod town and about 43 kms away from Kanhangad, stands at a height of 750 m above sea level and is the region of highest altitude in the district. The region was formerly known as Madathumala. The extensive forests here merge with the Coorg mountains of Karnataka. 

                The place is a paradise for trekkers and Nature lovers who are drawn by the evergreen shola forests, wildflowers, moors and the sprawling meadows. It is said that the breeze here has medicinal properties, as the meadows here are full of lemongrass which has antioxidant properties. If you are lucky, wild elephants can be spotted wandering in the mountains. The one side trek to the top is 2.5 kms. </p>

              <p class="card-text">The only man-made forest in the Kerala Kareem Forest park is spread over 32 acres of land. The park is situated at Puliyamkulam, near Parappa which is 23 km away east of kanhangad town. Kareem, a native of Kasaragod, is behind this great green venture. The forest park is located in Parappa near Nileshwar and is a remarkable example for forest conservation. Similar to any other natural forest Kareem’s forest park is rich with a variety of plants and shrubs. It also gives shelter to innumerable species of birds, small wild animals and medicinal plants. The forest is frequented by people from different walks of life, environmentalists, scientists, university and Ayurveda students, and laymen for practical experience and study purpose. Mr. Kareem is also multiplying and distributing the seeds and saplings of forest trees and medicinal plants to convert the waste lands into thick forests which in turn will rejuvenate the earth.</p>
