              <p class="card-text">With woods wrapped in mystery, idly flowing dreamy streams, captivating waterfalls and an exuberant wilderness, Perunthenaruvi is a lesser known gem waiting to get discovered! 

                Situated in the forest region of Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district, one of the major pilgrim centres of South India, Perunthenaruvi allures tourists with its breathtakingly beautiful waterfalls and the dazzling stream that flows to merge with the sacred Pamba River. The locality is the home turf of beehives which have bestowed the place with the title Perunthenaruvi meaning the “River of Honey”. 
                
                There is no better place to have a pleasant peaceful time than when you are romancing with nature and surround yourself with its purity to cleanse your soul. Perunthenaruvi offers you just that.
                
                You can either choose a 5-minute walk or a 20-minute trek through the tea plantations to reach the waterfalls here. The music of the cascades welcomes you even from afar. The hike leads you to a luxuriant waterfall with a luscious swimming hole that tempts one to leap into its deep waters. The stream gushes further beyond through the rocky bed to unite with the holy Pamba</p>

                A highlight of the Gavi Eco Project is the involvement of the local populace in its activities as guides, gardeners and cooks. This provides livelihood for the locals and also helps to create awareness on the conservation of nature. Gavi, located in Pathanamthitta district offers its visitors activities like trekking, wildlife watching, outdoor camping in specially built tents and night safaris.
                
                The road leading to Gavi is blanketed by tea plantations, which itself is a refreshing experience. En route to Gavi are places of interest like Mundakayyam, Kuttikanam, Peermedu and Vandiperiyar from where the road deviates to Gavi.</p>
