              <p class="card-text">Built by the first Portuguese Viceroy in India, Don Francesco de Almeida (1505), St. Angelo’s Fort is among the most historic sites in Kannur. This massive triangular laterite structure is flanked by gigantic bastions that make for an imposing sight. It changed hands between the Dutch and eventually the British, who would remodel and reequip it into their primary military stronghold in Malabar.

                Mopilla Bay and Dharamadam Island are among the primary attractions here. Mopilla Bay is a natural harbour and the fort offers a wonderful view of it along with a sea wall projecting from the fort separating the rough sea and inland water.  Dharamadam Island, barely 5 acres in area, is 100 m from the mainland and a favourite haunt of tourists. People come to the fort for relaxing strolls and just a brilliant view of the Arabian Sea</p>

              <p class="card-text">Muzhappilangad Beach is famous for being Kerala's only drive-in beach. At about 7km from Thalassery in Kannur, you have a 4 km stretch of sand that awaits you to simply drive along as you soak in the view of the beautiful Malabar Coast. Along the way, one gets to munch on delicacies from a number of shacks that offer authentic Malabar cuisine. It is often considered a swimmers paradise as the black rocks protect the beach from deep currents. This is a perfect way to relax and soak in this clean and well maintained beach. One can also partake in adventure sports like paragliding, parasailing and micro light flights along with water sports, power boating or a simple catamaran ride.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Kannur’s rich and vibrant landscape is host to the great Arakkal Kettu Museum, former residence of the only Muslim Royal Family in Kerala, the Arakkal Ali Rajas. Step inside this beautiful architectural marvel and be transported to a different era, with heirlooms and artefacts of their rein adorning the entire building.

                The museum exhibits artefacts and heirlooms of the royal family which includes the family seal, the pathayam (the wooden box in which grain was stored), document box and so on. The royal copies of the Holy Quran, an old-fashioned telephone, swords and daggers used by the rulers, and a telescope are also on display. 
                
                Apart from these, there are exhibits that stand as testimonies to the Arakkal rulers’ relationship with European colonial powers as well as those relating to their maritime activities and monopoly on spice trade.  
                
                It is a must visit site in the district, as it helps one gain an understanding of the cultural diversity that helped shape its current form.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">EZHIMALA</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Ezhimala (ezhu means seven and mala means mountain in Malayalam), is a seven-peaked mountain, about 55 kms from Kannur. The mountainous region, which stands at a height of about 286 m above sea level, is seven kilometres from Payyannur.

                The historically significant Ezhimala has an interesting past that dates back to the Sangha period. It was the headquarters of the Ezhimala kings and later, of the Mooshika kings. It witnessed the battles between Chola and Chera dynasties in the 11th century. At the foothills, there are relics of the distant past, such as burial chambers, carved stone pillars, caves and granite platforms.
                
                The area was a centre for trade during ancient times, and frequented by Arab traders. It is also believed that Lord Buddha visited the place once.
                
                A walk up hill reveals the ruins of a mosque, which is believed to house the remnants of Shaikh Abdul Latheef, a Muslim reformist. The winding road up is rich in herbs. The majestic serenity of the mountain peak and the green valleys are sure to be etched in the visitor's memory for a long time. 
                
                From Ezhimala, one can see the Mount Dilli lighthouse, the ruins of an old fort near it and a temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman. An important institution here is the Indian Naval Academy. Prior permission is required to visit the Academy.</p>
