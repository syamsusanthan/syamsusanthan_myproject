              <h5 class="card-title">MALAMPUZHA GARDEN</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Malampuzha Garden in Palakkad district is the only rock-cut garden in South India made by Nek Chand, the renowned artist and winner of the prestigious Padmashree Award. The entire garden is made from broken pieces of bangles, tiles, used plastic cans, tins and other waste materials. Also situated in the gardens is the massive Malampuzha Yakshi (female vampire) built in 1969 by Kanayi Kunhiraman, a greatly respected sculptor from the state. It is a spectacular relic of art that we are lucky to still have with us. The flowering beds, fountains and rose gardens along with an aerial ropeway make it a place that instantly soothes your soul.

                In the lower hills of the Western Ghats lies the beautiful Malampuzha township whose lush greenery and plethora of picnic spots make it a must-visit spot in these areas. It has really good trekking trails that are available to all with a penchant for the same. </p>

              <h5 class="card-title">NELLIYAMPATHY</h5>
              <p class="card-text">From the town of Nenmara in Palakkad district, the cloud-caressed peaks of the majestic Nelliyampathy Hill ranges are a sight to behold. The height of the hills ranges from 467 m to 1,572 m and it has an extremely calming effect on all who view it. To reach Nelliyampathy, one has to take the road starting from Nenmara that proceeds to the Pothundy Dam. There are about 10 hairpin bends that have to be negotiated on the way to Nelliyampathy.

                The Pothundy Dam is a beautiful locale with facilities for boating and is a nice option as a picnic place. As the Ghat road winds its way up to Nelliyampathy, at certain places there are viewpoints from where the vast stretches of Palakkad district are visible with its extensive paddy fields forming a verdant carpet. It also offers a splendid view of the Palakkad Gap, which is a geographical phenomenon in the Western Ghats formation in this region, bringing into view, parts of the adjoining State of Tamil Nadu.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Tipu's Fort, also known as Palakkad Fort, is a beautifully maintained edifice in Palakkad district and was an important military base in the past. Rebuilt by Hyder Ali in the 18th century, the fort was under the Mysore rulers until the British took control of the place. It was then used for providing government services during the British era. Named after Hyder's son Tipu Sultan, it is an important historical destination today.

                It is among the best preserved forts in South India. The thick laterite walls impress all who view it. People frequent the spot for relaxing walks and jogs. A large ground that lies between the Fort and the Palakkad town hall is an important location for public meetings and important functions. Today it is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. It is a preferred picnic spot for everyone visiting Palakkad.
