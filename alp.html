              <p class="card-text">An oasis of fun and frolic right by the side of a vast green-blue expanse, that is how the famed Alappuzha beach welcomes you. The palm-fringed beach, surrounded by lush greenery and historic structures, is a magical combination that serenades you into a land of wonders.

                As the swells of the ocean crash onto the shores and you listen to the gentle whispers of the cool breeze and the rhythmic song of the ocean, get ready to be transported to a tranquil space.
                
                One of the most popular picnic spots in Alappuzha, this beach is famous for an ancient pier and a lighthouse. The pier is over 140 years old and breathes history.  Built by Captain Crawford, this structure gives you a rare experience of walking right into the sea! The old lighthouse here is another fascinating feature that draws people to the beach.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">KUTTANAD</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Kuttanad, the 'Rice Bowl of Kerala’, lies at the very heart of the backwaters in Alappuzha district. Its wealth of paddy crops is what got it this unique nickname. Based in the inner regions of the district, it is a huge area of reclaimed land, separated by dikes from water which is higher than it appears. The view of the countryside is what enchants all who pass through this area while travelling via houseboats. It has been speculated that it is perhaps the only place in the world where farming is done up to 2 meters below sea level. The area is serviced by 4 major rivers: Pampa, Meenachil, Achankovil and Manimala. 

                The Alappuzha - Changanassery Road that passes through the heart of Kuttanad is famous for itsscenic view of this locale. One gets to view a slice of the traditional country lifestyle. Visits to these villages can be a life changing experience. Especially during the harvest season, one finds farmers working in the fields most of the day. The early hours of the day brings to us the sight of women carrying sickles to the fields while men are busy sowing seeds and getting rid of weeds. Fields with rice stalks have legions of parrots hovering around them. One may also see darter birds flying around as they are known to be around the area surrounding the backwaters.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Pathiramanal is a bird watcher’s paradise. It is about 1.5 km from Muhamma Boat Jetty and about 13 km from Alappuzha. This small island on the backwaters is a safe haven for hundreds of rare migrating birds. A 1.5 hour motor boat ride or a 30 minute speedboat trip from Alappuzha gets you here. Surrounded by the Vembanad Lake, stretching from Alappuzha to Kochi and the Kayamkulam Lake, Pathiramanal is accessible only by boat. It is an ideal pit stop in the middle of a houseboat ride.

                The name 'Pathiramanal' means 'Sands of Night'. Estimates say that the area has 91 local species of birds and 50 migratory birds. One can see Pintail Ducks, Common Teal, Night Heron, Cormorant, Darter, Indian Shag, Purple Heron, Cattle Egret, Indian Pond Heron, Little Egret, Bronze-winged Jacanas, Stork-billed Kingfisher, Whistling Duck, Cotton Pygmy-Goose, Little Cormorant and Whiskered Tern.
