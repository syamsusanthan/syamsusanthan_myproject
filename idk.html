              <p class="card-text">The idea of a hydroelectric project over the Periyar River occurred to W H John, the then superintendent of Malankara Estate. John, in an article published in Malayala Manorama daily in 1935, detailed the prospects of such a project.

                Kuravan and Kurathi hills, the core area of the project, were introduced to John by Chemban Kolumban, a member of the local Oorali tribe. Kolumban with his wide knowledge of the forest later became an accomplice of the engineers who came for site inspection. As a token of appreciation for Kolumban’s services, the KSEB later allowed a monthly pension of Rs. 40 to Kolumban. There also stands a memorial to Kolumban on the dam site.
                
                In 1937, two Italian engineers submitted a project proposal for a 50,000 KW hydroelectric project on Periyar River to the Government of Travancore. It was followed by a site visit by a team led by Electricity Chief Engineer of Travancore Government Joseph John in 1947.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Cool, green hills and the fresh mountain air make Ramakkalmedu an enchanting retreat. The place gets its name from the impressions of the feet found on the rock surface here, which is believed to be of Rama, the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, as told in the Indian epic Ramayana.

                Located in Idukki district of Kerala, Ramakkalmedu is about 40 km from Thekkady, which is one of the popular wildlife destinations in Kerala. The captivating hills of Ramakkalmedu in the Western Ghats, which is about 16 km from Nedumkandam.
                
                Ramakkalmedu is noted for its hills and also for the panoramic and picturesque views of villages in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, which is towards the eastern side of the Western Ghats. A noticeably tall, pillar-like rocky structure, about 300 m high and facing east is another attraction here.
                
                It is one of the windiest places in Asia and being so, one can also find here a wind farm generating electricity, which is an undertaking of the Government of Kerala.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Anamudi, the 2,695-m high mountain which stands tall in the Eravikulam National Park is the pride of Kerala. It is the highest point in India outside the Himalayan Mountain Ranges. Anamudi, together with the Eravikulam Park, is home to one of the largest surviving populations of Asian elephants, Gaurs and the Nilgiri Tahrs. The mountain, covered with evergreen forests and inhabited by endemic flora and fauna and a vibrant avian life, is a paradise in the wild. The green forest is also the source of some large and scenic rivers in Kerala and the nearby State of Tamil Nadu. Take a trek to the top of the mountain and know how it would feel when you are above every human in South India !

                Those who wish to trek should take permission from the Eravikulam National Park authorities. It is also recommended to contact the authorities for details on trekking and weather.</p>

              <p class="card-text">How often have you visited a national park in the background of tea plantations? Here is one such national park in the high ranges of Kerala which offers the magnificent view of hills with tea plantations - the Eravikulam National Park. Situated in the Kannan Devan Hills of the southern Western Ghats, the wildlife park with an area of 97 sq. km. can be reached via Munnar. Located in the Devikulam Taluk of Idukki district in Kerala, after reaching Munnar, you need to take the road going to Rajamala to reach this national park. 

                The national park is a protected area and is divided into three regions - the core area, the buffer area and the tourism area. Visitors are allowed only to the tourism area that is in Rajamala, the region lying beyond the road entry into Eravikulam. Eravikulam is also famous for the natural habitat of Nilgiri Tahr, the endangered mountain goat and this park is built with the aim of conserving them.  
                
                Every twelve years, this place will be carpeted with blue… Yes, your guess is correct. It is one the place where you can witness the mass flowering of Neelakurinji flowers. </p>
