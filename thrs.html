              <p class="card-text">As you walk down the stone slabs that lead to the base of the Athirappilly waterfalls, a mysterious serenity overcomes you. It is Kerala's most famous and largest waterfall at over 80 ft high. The sight of the water crashing onto the ground leaves you with a sense of wonder at the sheer power and magnificence of nature. Located around 63 km from Thrissur district, it is a perennial picnic spot for people in the area and  beyond. Its surrounding greenery is perfect for walks and picnics with loved ones. Lying at the entrance to the Sholayar forest ranges, it is a part of the Chalakudy River which calls the Western Ghats its home.

                Barely 5 km away is another family favourite, Vazhachal Waterfalls. These waterfalls became famous for not just their view but the endemic species found in the surrounding dense forests. Researchers have found four endangered species of the Hornbill here, the only place they thrive in the entire Western Ghats.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Kerala Kalamandalam has, for decades, been regarded as the most prestigious Kathakali school in the entire world. This legendary school of art is located in Cheruthuruthy and was originally set up by the famous poet of Malayalam, Vallathol Narayana Menon. The story goes that he recognised a subtle decrease in the interest people had in Kathakali and other traditional art forms and thus started the venture. Today, the Kalamandalam is the foremost proponent of a variety of traditional performing art forms that include Mohiniyattam, Kutiyattam, Thullal and Nangiarkoothu. It is also an official deemed University for Art and Culture.

                Founded in 1930 along the banks of the Nila (Bharathapuzha) River in Thrissur District, its ambience has assisted and nurtured Keralaâ€™s traditional art forms for nearly a century. Performances and classes are regularly held in Kalamandalam, fostered by its quaint charm.</p>
